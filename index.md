# Donate USD digital:
USD Digital token is not itself a US dollar, but Paxos Trust Company, LLC is responsible for backing each token with a US dollar held in segregated accounts at FDIC-insured, U.S. banks. Paxos Trust Company, LLC is also responsible for issuing and redeeming each token in exchange for $1.00 USD. You can start to generate USDD with $0 investment from **bluemagic** link above as of today (1/10/2021). I am keeping my finger crossed to get some funding for my cancer research ML program :).
